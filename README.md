### **Heart Disease Classification and Clustering Project**  
This project focuses on the **analysis and prediction of heart disease** using classification and clustering techniques. The dataset utilized provides various clinical and lifestyle features to help understand patterns and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The project combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, machine learning, and clustering techniques to gain actionable insights.

#### **Key Features**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify trends, distributions, and correlations between features.  
   - Visualizations to highlight key indicators of heart disease, including cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age.  
   - Insights into demographic trends, such as age and gender influences.  

2. **Classification Modeling**:  
   - Developed classification models using **PyCaret** to predict the presence of heart disease.  
   - Tested multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble models.  
   - Optimized models to achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall, ensuring robust predictions.  

3. **Clustering Analysis**:  
   - Implemented clustering techniques like **K-Means** to group patients based on risk factors and clinical profiles.  
   - Identified distinct clusters to better understand patient segments and their respective risks.  
   - Generated insights to support targeted prevention and treatment strategies.  

4. **Results and Insights**:  
   - Determined key features influencing heart disease, such as cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and blood pressure.  
   - Developed actionable insights for medical professionals to identify high-risk individuals.  
   - Provided a data-driven approach to patient segmentation using clustering results.  

5. **Deployment**:  
   - A GitHub repository containing:
     - Python scripts for EDA, classification, and clustering.
     - Visualizations and results from the analysis.
     - Data set file

#### **Tools and Technologies**:  
- **PyCaret**: Simplified machine learning workflows for classification and clustering.  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.  
- **GitHub**: For project hosting and collaboration.
- **Power BI ** : for dashboard
